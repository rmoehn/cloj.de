    <p><em>All this is old stuff. The chemistry protocols linked at the bottom of the page are still popular.</em></p><p>The following products of my work seem to expose a rather peregrine interest. While this is partly true, the diversity is also a result of rash decisions and a lack of alternatives. And my versatility and quick learning, to see the positive aspects. You should also note that these are real, finished, useful work products, wheres what I have on <a href="/GitHub">GitHub</a> is mostly unfinished or not usable as a product. (It might still be usable in the sense that you can learn from it.)</p><p>The LaTeX sources and translations are available on request.</p><h2 id="bachelors-thesis-2014">Bachelor's Thesis (2014)</h2><p>I wrote my Bachelor's thesis about <a href="http://www.eluaproject.net/">eLua</a> and the MSB-IOT, a little sensor board developed in the <a href="http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-tech/">Computer Systems and Telematics</a> working group at Freie Universität Berlin. The process of creating it was not optimal, so the outcome isn't optimal either. But <a href="/bach-elua-msbiot.pdf">here</a> you can download it anyway.</p><h2 id="work-at-small-apps-2012-2013">Work at Small Apps (2012, 2013)</h2><p>In 2012 I did my compulsory internship at <a href="http://www.small-apps.com/">Small Apps</a> and followed it up with some holiday work in 2013. I did some uninformed PHP hacking and then developed two Android apps:</p><ul><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smallapps.creevey">Creevey</a> – note-taking for analog photographers</li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smallapps.regattakalender">Regattakalender</a> – the Android version of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/regattakalender/id445473224?mt=8">iOS app</a> for finding sailing regattas</li></ul><p>I also prepared the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smallapps.betterprotocols">BetterProtocols</a> for publication. This was mainly bug fixing (and drawing the clipboard in the icon).</p><h2 id="proseminar-introductory-seminar-course-2012">Proseminar (introductory seminar course) (2012)</h2><p>This was a course on logic programming. We had to make a presentation and a report on some subject. Mine was <a href="/logprog-negation.pdf">Theory of Logic Programming with Negation</a>, in particular negation as failure (NAF) and SLDNF resolution.</p><h2 id="molecular-dynamics-with-the-computer-2011">Molecular Dynamics with the Computer (2011)</h2><p>In this course we simulated the reaction between <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/448.abstract">neutral muonic helium</a>, which apparently can be seen as hydrogen isotope ⁴·¹H, and chlorine to some sort of hydrochloric acid (⁴·¹HCl). This involved LEPS and Morse potentials and trajectories and mobile coordinates and other stuff I can't remember. The <a href="/molecular-dynamics.pdf">final report</a> is quite funny for its convoluted Fortran code and the humbly-impressive Gnuplot plots, though. When I recompiled it in order to remove code from the instructor and put in the license notice, strange horizontal lines got introduced into four of the pictures. No idea why.</p><h2 id="inorganic-chemistry-lab-protocols-2011">Inorganic Chemistry Lab Protocols (2011)</h2><p>These are lab protocols and presentations about syntheses I made together with my lab partner Florian Noack while doing a course in inorganic chemistry. Have a look at them for the fancy pictures I drew with <a href="http://xfig.org/userman/">XFig</a>!</p><ul><li><a href="/halogenides-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> and <a href="/halogenides-protocol.pdf">protocol</a> about synthesising sodium chloride (NaCl), aluminium iodide (Aluminiumiodid, AlI₃) and magnesium iodide (MgI₂) from the elements</li><li><a href="/thiostannate-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> and <a href="/thiostannate-protocol.pdf">protocol</a> about synthesising sodium tritiostannate (Na₄Sn₂S₆ · 14 H₂O) from sodium sulfide (Na₂S) and tin tetrachloride (SnCl₄ · 5 H₂O)</li><li><a href="/mohrs-salt.pdf">protocol</a> about synthesising Mohr's salt (Mohrsches Salz, ammonium-iron(II) sulfate-hexahydrate, (NH₄)₂Fe(SO₄)₂ · 6 H₂O) from iron and ammonium sulfate</li><li><a href="/electrochemistry-protocol.pdf">protocol</a> about some electrochemical experiments exploring Nernst's equation and determining the solubility product of silver chloride</li></ul>
