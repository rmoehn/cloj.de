    <p>I derived this recipe from <a href="https://fankhauserblog.wordpress.com/2000/08/08/making-ginger-ale-at-home/">David Fankhauser: Making Ginger Ale at Home</a> and the ginger bug in Katz, Sandor Ellix: <em>Wild Fermentation. The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods</em> (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2003).</p><ul><li><p>I replace the yeast used in the former with the latter, so that I get a wild starter.</p></li><li><p>I put in more sugar and ferment for several weeks, aiming for an alcohol content of around 5 % by volume.

After a day or two they should be quite hard. Carefully loosen the lid, so that gas comes out, but still maintain some pressure.</li><li>Every few days, tighten the lid, invert the bottles and loosen the lid again.</li><li>After some time (probably at least two weeks), screw the lid tight and let ferment until the bottles are quite hard. Put them in the fridge.</li><li>Once they are properly cooled, the beer is ready for consumption. Be careful with opening.</li></ol><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><ul><li>It might be a good idea to use bottles which contained something sparkling before. Others might not be built to withstand high pressure.</li><li>In the winter months I found it quite useful to put the bottles on top of a radiator. – Cozy warmth speeds up the fermentation, but is by no means necessary. It would be a sin to turn on extra heating just to make this ginger beer.</li><li>If during the final fermentation not enough pressure is generated, you might add a teaspoon of sugar to each bottle and ferment for some more days.</li><li>When mixing the ginger-sugar-ginger bug mixture in the beginning, it might not be a good idea trying to dissolve all the sugar in the ginger bug. The osmotic pressure would kill the yeast.</li><li>I can't give a good total fermentation time, because it is very dependent on the environment and the mode of letting out gas. A carboy with airlock would probably be fastest.</li></ul><h2 id="notes-on-the-last-batch">Notes on the last batch</h2><ul><li>Started the last batch at 2014-02-28. Still fermenting.</li><li>Ginger bug had nearly died because of too much sugar. Saved it by halving and filling up with water.</li><li>Non-carbonated water bottles from Bilka are not so well-suited.</li></ul>
