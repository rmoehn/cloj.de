There is a Gist containing sort of a <a href="https://gist.github.com/rmoehn/9176431">cooking diary</a> in which the development of some of those recipes can be observed. I'll try and and merge these recipes and that diary, though.</p></li><li><p>The recipes are usually optimized for health and nutritious value and quick, easy and regular production. Don't expect revelations in taste and cooking technique, therefore.</p></li><li><p>Often the recipes contain very precise specifications. These are mainly notes for myself in case I wanted to reproduce something. They are not meant to be adhered to very closely. In fact, most of the fermentation things are impossible to do reproducibly without elaborate equipment.</p></li><li><p>I try to eliminate superstition from my recipes. If you find an instruction that appears not to make sense, please notice me.</p></li><li><p>Many food websites feature gorgeous pictures. Mine doesn't have any, apart from some unicode art, because I don't have a decent camera. Since no pictures means fewer visitors (as of now I don't have any, so that's a relief), I'd be happy about help with that condition. Some suggestions: follow the recipes and send me your pictures, give me your old-but-decent camera, give me some money for buying a decent camera.</p></li></ul>
