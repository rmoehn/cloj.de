Just focusing on the Lisp literature, I haven't read <em>Lisp in Small Pieces</em>, <em>The Art of the Metaobject Protocol</em>, <em>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp</em>, <em>Essentials of Programming Languages</em>. I have read <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> and <em>On Lisp</em> only half. I have begun reading <em>Let Over Lambda</em>. Why am I telling you what I haven't read? Because the main reason (beside that being a ton of text) is that those books are not easily and affordably available. I am a student. Students have no money. So they go to the library. But the library has no books. At least not the ones listed up there. They have mountains of rubbish instead. Buy them? Forget it. Most of those books are really old tomes. They are out of print, available second-hand for hilariously high prices, nobody makes any revenue with them anymore and still nobody cares to put them online.</p><p>Okay, that was my original rant. Actually only some of them are really old tomes and hilariously overpriced. The others come at usual prices for technical writing, which is still forbiddingly high for a student on a tight budget. So I should go on ranting a bit more against libraries. Is it only the Berlin ones which have no taste in selecting programming books? But my spring of rant has dried up for today. I'll finish with some praise:</p><p>Hats off to SICP, On Lisp and Let Over Lambda. They are a bit hard to read on my aged ebook reader and I'm gnawing my way through, but they are online and I thank those people who made them available. May others follow their example.</p><h2 id="john-e-sarno-the-mindbody-prescription">John E. Sarno: The Mindbody Prescription</h2><p>There are many people on the internet writing about their RSI and there are many people on the internet writing about their experience with Sarno's methods, but for some reason these sets appear largely disjunct. I have no idea whether his theories are correct, but everyone who suffers from RSI should read that book anyway. And everyone else, too.</p><h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2><p>(There ought to be lots (and lots) of items on this list, which is why it originally didn't exist. However, Eliezer Yudkowski asks for spreading the word and this is what I do.)</p><ul><li>Eliezer Yudkowski: <a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></li></ul>
