    <title>Richard Möhn&#39;s Old Home Page: Yes, amazake mix (before fermenting) should be fairly dry.</title>

The fermentation will turn it into porridge.">

    <p>This is just a quick note. When I made <strong>amazake</strong> for the first time, I followed Makiko Ito's <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2016/02/19/food/amazake-wintertime-sake-isnt-seems/">recipe in the Japan Times</a>. After I stirred together cooked rice, water and koji I found that the <strong>mix was quite dry</strong>. I thought it would be soupy! Checking the amounts three times and looking at several other webpages made me more confident that it should indeed be dry and would become <strong>liquid over the course of the fermentation</strong>. And it did!</p><p>So, if you've mixed together rice, water and koji and it looks like a mound of mushy rice with hard bits in it (the koji grains): this is how it should be. The fermentation will turn it into porridge.</p>
