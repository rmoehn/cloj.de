    <p><em>This is outdated.</em></p><p>I want to improve the current and future state of <strong>humanity</strong>. As I've studied <strong>computer science</strong>, I figure that an effective way of doing that is to research AI safety. This is what I'm doing now as a research student at Kagoshima University. I wouldn't say I'm doing research, though; rather, I'm trying to understand the basics, so that I can do research later.</p><p>On this my homepage I post stuff I know well and that is not available anywhere else (as far as I know). Strangely, this stuff is mostly about efficient and plant-based cooking (with international inspiration). You'll also find stuff about programming, since I'm a decent programmer with a unique viewpoint.</p><p>I could go on bragging about what I'm good at, but that would be boring. Sometimes I try to find out what the basis of my »being good at many things« is. My current summary is: <strong>I'm good at learning and immediately applying what I've learned in every context possible</strong> (i.e. not just in the context where I've learned it).</p><p>If you want to contact me, know more about me, ask me some question, feel free to email me.</p>
